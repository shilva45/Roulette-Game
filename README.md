In this version of roulette, you get to shoot your opponent!

If you shoot your opponent and it is a live round, your opponent loses a life! Otherwise, you lose your turn.

You can also choose to shoot yourself, and if you fire a blank round, you get to move again! If you fire a live round, you lose a life.

At the start of each chamber, each player will receive items to help them in winning the game!
